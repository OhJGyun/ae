    # --- Vehicle Parameters ---
    wheel_base: 0.324          # Distance between front and rear axles (m)
    car_width: 0.30            # Full width of the car (m)

    # --- Disparity Detection Parameters ---
    max_range: 10.0            # Maximum LiDAR range to consider (m)
    gap_threshold: 1.5         # Minimum gap size to be considered as disparity (m) - REDUCED for hairpins
    disparity_margin: 1.3      # Safety margin for disparity extension (m) - REDUCED for tighter turns

    # --- Control Parameters ---
    v_max: 8.0                 # Maximum velocity (m/s)
    v_min: 1.0                 # Minimum velocity (m/s)
    max_steer: 0.45            # Maximum steering angle (radians, ~25.8 degrees)

    # --- Waypoint Selection Parameters ---
    lookahead_min: 0.8         # Minimum lookahead distance (m) - INCREASED for hairpins
    lookahead_max: 3.5         # Maximum lookahead distance (m) - INCREASED for better planning

    # --- Control Tuning ---
    steering_gain: 1.1         # Proportional gain for steering - INCREASED for sharper turns
    steering_smoothing: 0.7    # Steering smoothing factor (0-1, higher = more responsive) - INCREASED for hairpins
    speed_reduction_factor: 0.9 # Speed reduction based on steering angle - INCREASED to slow down more in turns

    # --- Waypoint Stability ---
    enable_waypoint_stability: true  # Enable waypoint jump detection
    waypoint_jump_threshold: 2.5     # Maximum allowed waypoint jump distance (m) - INCREASED for hairpin transitions

    # --- Visualization Parameters ---
    enable_visualization: true  # Enable/disable RViz markers
    marker_frame: "map"       # Frame for visualization markers
    waypoint_marker_size: 0.3   # Size of waypoint sphere marker (m)

    # --- Debug ---
    verbose_logging: true       # Enable detailed logging
